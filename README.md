## Dev notes

### Adding tooltip-infos

*Tooltip infos will be shown next to an element when hovering and can be attached to any element by adding a `class` and `data`-attribute to the element.*

-  Add `class="tt"`
- Add `data-tt="YOUR TEXT"`

E.g. `<div class="tt" data-tt="Infos about this div"></div>`
